### Testspace CI testings

The objectives are to validate:
  * CI specific testing for Standalone Projects
  * CI specific testing fro Connected Projects
  * CI support for `Matrix` (multiple jobs)
  * General concurrency / load testing

***

### Master

The corresponding Testspace Project branch(space) `code churn` will represent the `Testspace` repo changes. 


This branch will be used to generate the pre-canned content used by the other branches.

Starting with pre-canned `results.xml`:

<pre>
sudo pip install pytest
py.test generate-results.py --junitxml=results.xml -v --tb=no
</pre>

The Testspace branch(space) content will be pushed from a private repo used to trigger the `other` branches to execute their specific CI tests.
The [trigger repo](https://github.com/s2technologies/testspace.test.ci.trigger) is a `private` repo. 

### Standalone

This branch is used by ALL CIs to push content. Requires CI Environment Variables (via UI) set to `S2_TOKEN=...`.

### Other

All of the other branches, named based on what CI runs, are used to test Matrix/Concurrency specific to the CI.
